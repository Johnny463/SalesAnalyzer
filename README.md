# Sales Analyzer API

The Sales Analyzer API is a backend system that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze sales data and provide various insights and forecasts. This README provides an overview of the API, its functionalities, and instructions for usage.

## Overview

The Sales Analyzer API consists of three main components:

1. **Performance Feedback Endpoint**: An endpoint to query performance feedback for a specific sales representative.
2. **Overall Team Performance Endpoint**: An endpoint to assess the overall performance of the sales team.
3. **Sales Performance Trends and Forecasting Endpoint**: An endpoint for analyzing sales performance trends and forecasting future sales.

## Data Sheets

The API relies on three main data sheets:

1. **Building Information Sheet**: Contains information about different buildings, including their ID, name, address, city, description, neighborhood, amenities, etc.
2. **Sales Data Sheet**: Records sales transactions, including unit IDs, prices, and timestamps.
3. **Unit Information Sheet**: Provides details about individual units, including building ID, floor name, unit number, bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, price, and availability date.
